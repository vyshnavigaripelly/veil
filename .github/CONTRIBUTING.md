# How To Contribute

First of all, I would like to say thank you for being interested in contributing to the Veil-Framework!
Anything you contribute makes my life easier, I do really appreciate it.  For the time being, I'm 
going to try to break this up by sections.  Don't read the whole thing (unless you really want to),
just check out the section that applies to you.

Thanks again for your help!  #avlol

## Creating Github Issues

There's a couple pieces of information that we will need if you create a Github issue.  Some of the
primary information is:

* Please provide the version of Veil you are using
* Please provide the OS that you are using (version included)
* Please provide the error that you are receiving
  * Please post the error on Pastebin, or another similar site, an post the link in the issue
  * Please do NOT post a giant code snippet all within the issue itself
* Please provide the output/functionality you expected (vs. what you received)

Please be sure to include all of the above information, otherwise we may not have enough information
to help fix the issue at hand.

## Submitting Modules

Here's a couple of tips that can help when submitting a module:

* Please test the module to make sure it works with the latest version of the master branch
* Please ensure all requirements are installed within Kali for the module to work
  * If you need an extra library to be installed, be sure to call that information out
* Please randomize every variable, or everything as much as possible within your module
  * Feel free to use the helpers.randomString() function for this
